# learn-docker

A place to keep my docker maifests and automation. 

# getting started

## install docker on linux

```shell
sudo true
wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

Add your account to the docker group. Unless you want to do sudo every time you need to see the daemon. 

```shell
sudo usermod -aG docker your-user
```
